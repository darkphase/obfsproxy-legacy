obfsproxy: a pluggable transports proxy

obfsproxy is a pluggable transports proxy written in C. It's compliant
to the Tor pluggable transports specification, and its modular
architecture allows it to support multiple pluggable transports.

To build obfsproxy from source:
   ./configure && make

If you got the source from git, run "./autogen.sh", which will run the
various auto* programs. Then you can run ./configure, and refer to the
above instructions.

See doc/ for more obfsproxy information.
